=head1 NAME

Git::More - An extension of App::gh::Git with some goodies for hook developers.

=head1 VERSION

version 0.009

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Git::More;

    my $git = Git::More->repository();

    my $config  = $git->get_config('section');
    my $branch  = $git->get_current_branch();
    my $commits = $git->get_refs_commits();
    my $message = $git->get_commit_msg('HEAD');

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is an extension of the C<App::gh::Git> class. It's meant to
implement a few extra methods commonly needed by Git hook developers.

In particular, it's used by the standard hooks implemented by the
C<Git::Hooks> framework.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 get_config

This method groks the configuration options for the repository. It
returns every option found by invoking C<git config --list>.

The options are returned as a hash-ref pointing to a two-level
hash. For example, if the config options are these:

    section1.a=1
    section1.b=2
    section1.b=3
    section2.x.a=A
    section2.x.b=B
    section2.x.b=C

Then, it'll return this hash:

    {
        'section1' => {
            'a' => [1],
            'b' => [2, 3],
        },
        'section2' => {
            'x.a' => ['A'],
            'x.b' => ['B', 'C'],
        },
    }

The first level keys are the part of the option names before the first
dot. The second level keys are everything after the first dot in the
option names. You won't get more levels than two. In the example
above, you can see that the option "section2.x.a" is split in two:
"section2" in the first level and "x.a" in the second.

The values are always array-refs, even it there is only one value to a
specific option. For some options, it makes sense to have a list of
values attached to them. But even if you expect a single value to an
option you may have it defined in the global scope and redefined in
the local scope. In this case, it will appear as a two-element array,
the last one being the local value.

So, if you want to treat an option as single-valued, you should fetch
it like this:

     $h->{section1}{a}[-1]
     $h->{section2}{'x.a'}[-1]

=head2 get_current_branch

This method returns the repository's current branch name, as indicated
by the C<git branch> command. Note that its a ref shortname, i.e.,
it's usually subintended to reside under the 'refs/heads/' ref scope.

=head2 get_commits OLDCOMMIT NEWCOMMIT

This method returns a list of hashes representing every commit
reachable from NEWCOMMIT but not from OLDCOMMIT. It obtains this
information by invoking C<git rev-list OLDCOMIT..NEWCOMMIT>.

Each commit is represented by a hash with the following structure (the
codes are explained in the C<git help rev-list> document):

    {
        commit          => %H:  commit hash
        tree            => %T:  tree hash
        parent          => %P:  parent hashes (space separated)
        author_name     => %aN: author name
        author_email    => %aE: author email
        author_date     => %ai: author date in ISO8601 format
        commmitter_name => %cN: committer name
        committer_email => %cE: committer email
        committer_date  => %ci: committer date in ISO8601 format
        body            => %B:  raw body (aka commit message)
    }

=head2 get_commit_msg COMMIT_ID

This method returns the commit message (aka body) of the commit
identified by COMMIT_ID. The result is a string.
