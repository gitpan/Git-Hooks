    # configuration sections specific of the plugins. In version 0.023
    # the three existing plugins (check-acls.pl, check-jira.pl, and
    # check-structure.pl) were converted to proper modules and renamed
    # to the usual CamelCase form of the names (i.e., CheckAcls.pm,
    # CheckJira.pm, and CheckStructure.pm). To preserve compatibility
    # with already configured hooks here we inject the old names in

=head1 NAME

Git::More - A Git extension with some goodies for hook developers.

=head1 VERSION

version 0.050

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Git::More;

    my $git = Git::More->repository();

    my $config  = $git->get_config();
    my $branch  = $git->get_current_branch();
    my $commits = $git->get_commits($oldcommit, $newcommit);
    my $message = $git->get_commit_msg('HEAD');

    my $files_modified_by_commit = $git->get_diff_files('--diff-filter=AM', '--cached');
    my $files_modified_by_push   = $git->get_diff_files('--diff-filter=AM', $oldcommit, $newcommit);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is an extension of the C<Git> class. It's meant to implement a
few extra methods commonly needed by Git hook developers.

In particular, it's used by the standard hooks implemented by the
C<Git::Hooks> framework.

Note that the Git module is distributed along with git and it's not on
CPAN yet. So, it's possible that C<Git::More> can't find it in the
default directories in @INC. You have to find it and make it available
to your Perl in order to install Git::Hooks and to use it. Here are a
few options to do that:

=over

=item * Move it to one of the directories already in @INC.

=item * Add the directory where you found it to the C<PERL5LIB>
environment variable.

=item * Add the directory where you found it to the C<GITPERLLIB>
environment variable. This method is arguably better than the previous
one because C<GITPERLLIB> is used specifically to find C<Git.pm>
whereas C<PERL5LIB> directories are used to find any required/used
module in your program.

=back

(If you have trouble finding Git.pm, here is a tip. There are some
Perl scripts distributed along with git that use C<Git.pm>. Take a
look at the C<git-svn> script which should be installed in the
directory returned by the C<git --exec-path> command. In it's second
line there is a mention to a directory where it looks for C<Git.pm>.)

=head1 METHODS

=head2 get_config [SECTION [VARIABLE]]

This method groks the configuration options for the repository by
invoking C<git config --list>. The configuration is cached during the
first invokation in the object C<Git::More> object. So, if the
configuration is changed afterwards, the method won't notice it. This
is usually ok for hooks, though.

With no arguments, the options are returned as a hash-ref pointing to
a two-level hash. For example, if the config options are these:

    section1.a=1
    section1.b=2
    section1.b=3
    section2.x.a=A
    section2.x.b=B
    section2.x.b=C

Then, it'll return this hash:

    {
        'section1' => {
            'a' => [1],
            'b' => [2, 3],
        },
        'section2.x' => {
            'a' => ['A'],
            'b' => ['B', 'C'],
        },
    }

The first level keys are the part of the option names before the last
dot. The second level keys are everything after the last dot in the
option names. You won't get more levels than two. In the example
above, you can see that the option "section2.x.a" is split in two:
"section2.x" in the first level and "a" in the second.

The values are always array-refs, even it there is only one value to a
specific option. For some options, it makes sense to have a list of
values attached to them. But even if you expect a single value to an
option you may have it defined in the global scope and redefined in
the local scope. In this case, it will appear as a two-element array,
the last one being the local value.

So, if you want to treat an option as single-valued, you should fetch
it like this:

    $h->{section1}{a}[-1]
    $h->{'section2.x'}{a}[-1]

If the SECTION argument is passed, the method returns the second-level
hash for it. So, following the example above, this call:

    $git->get_config('section1');

This call would return this hash:

    {
        'a' => [1],
        'b' => [2, 3],
    }

If the section don't exist an empty hash is returned. Any key/value
added to the returned hash will be available in subsequent invokations
of C<get_config>.

If the VARIABLE argument is also passed, the method returns the
value(s) of the configuration option C<SECTION.VARIABLE>. In list
context the method returns the list of all values or the empty list,
if the variable isn't defined. In scalar context, the method returns
the variable's last value or C<undef>, if it's not defined.

=head2 cache SECTION

This method may be used by plugin developers to cache information in
the context of a Git::More object. SECTION is a string (usually a
plugin name) that is associated with a hash-ref. The method simply
returns the hash-ref, which can be used by the caller to store any
kind of information.

=head2 clean_cache SECTION

This method deletes the cache entry for SECTION. It may be used by
hooks just before returning to B<Git::Hooks::run_hooks> in order to
get rid of any value kept in the SECTION's cache.

=head2 get_commits OLDCOMMIT NEWCOMMIT

This method returns a list of hashes representing every commit
reachable from NEWCOMMIT but not from OLDCOMMIT. It obtains this
information by invoking C<git rev-list NEWCOMMIT ^OLDCOMMIT>.

There are two special cases, though:

If NEWCOMMIT is the null SHA-1, i.e.,
'0000000000000000000000000000000000000000', this means that a branch,
pointing to OLDCOMMIT, has been removed. In this case the method
returns an empty list, meaning that no new commit has been created.

If OLDCOMMIT is the null SHA-1, this means that a new branch poiting
to NEWCOMMIT is being created. In this case we want all commits
reachable from NEWCOMMIT but not reachable from any other branch. The
syntax for this is NEWCOMMIT ^B1 ^B2 ... ^Bn", i.e., NEWCOMMIT
followed by every other branch name prefixed by carets. We can get at
their names using the technique described in, e.g., L<this
discussion|http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3511057/git-receive-update-hooks-and-new-branches>.

Each commit in the returned list is represented by a hash with the
following structure (the codes are explained in the C<git help
rev-list> document):

    {
        commit          => %H:  commit hash
        tree            => %T:  tree hash
        parent          => %P:  parent hashes (space separated)
        author_name     => %aN: author name
        author_email    => %aE: author email
        author_date     => %ai: author date in ISO8601 format
        commmitter_name => %cN: committer name
        committer_email => %cE: committer email
        committer_date  => %ci: committer date in ISO8601 format
        body            => %B:  raw body (aka commit message)
    }

=head2 get_commit_msg COMMIT_ID

This method returns the commit message (a.k.a. body) of the commit
identified by COMMIT_ID. The result is a string.

=head2 read_commit_msg_file FILENAME

This method returns the relevant contents of the commit message file
called FILENAME. It's useful during the C<commit-msg> and the
C<prepare-commit-msg> hooks.

The file is read using the character encoding defined by the
C<i18n.commitencoding> configuration option or C<utf-8> if not
defined.

Some non-relevant contents are stripped off the file. Specifically:

=over

=item * diff data

Sometimes, the commit message file contains the diff data for the
commit. This data begins with a line starting with the fixed string
C<diff --git a/>. Everything from such a line on is stripped off the
file.

=item * comment lines

Every line beginning with a C<#> character is stripped off the file.

=item * trailing spaces

Any trailing space is stripped off from all lines in the file.

=item * trailing empty lines

Any empty line at the end is stripped off from the file, making sure
it ends in a single newline.

=back

All this cleanup is performed to make it easier for different plugins
to analyse the commit message using a canonical base.

=head2 write_commit_msg_file FILENAME, MSG, ...

This method writes the list of strings C<MSG> to FILENAME. It's useful
during the C<commit-msg> and the C<prepare-commit-msg> hooks.

The file is written to using the character encoding defined by the
C<i18n.commitencoding> configuration option or C<utf-8> if not
defined.

An empty line (C<\n\n>) is inserted between every pair of MSG
arguments, if there is more than one, of course.

=head2 get_diff_files DIFFARGS...

This method invokes the command C<git diff --name-status> with extra
options and arguments as passed to it. It returns a reference to a
hash mapping every affected files to their affecting status. Its
purpose is to make it easy to grok the names of files affected by a
commit or a sequence of commits. Please, read C<git help diff> to know
everything about its options.

A common usage is to grok every file added or modified in a pre-commit
hook:

    my $hash_ref = $git->get_diff_files('--diff-filter=AM', '--cached');

Another one is to grok every file added or modified in a pre-receive
hook:

    my $hash_ref = $git->get_diff_files('--diff-filter=AM', $old_commit, $new_commit);

=head2 set_affected_ref REF OLDCOMMIT NEWCOMMIT

This method should be used in the beginning of an C<update>,
C<pre-receive>, or C<post-receive> hook in order to record the
references that were affected by the push command. The information
recorded will be later used by the following C<get_affected_ref*>
methods.

=head2 get_affected_refs

This method returns the list of names of references that were affected
by the current push command, as they were set by calls to the
C<set_affected_ref> method.

=head2 get_affected_ref_range(REF)

This method returns the two-element list of commit ids representing
the OLDCOMMIT and the NEWCOMMIT of the affected REF.

=head2 get_affected_ref_commit_ids(REF)

This method returns the list of commit ids leading from the affected
REF's NEWCOMMIT to OLDCOMMIT.

=head2 get_affected_ref_commits(REF)

This routine returns the list of commits leading from the affected
REF's NEWCOMMIT to OLDCOMMIT. The commits are represented by hashes,
as returned by the C<get_commits> method.

=head2 authenticated_user

This method returns the username of the authenticated user performing
the Git action. It groks it from the C<githooks.userenv> configuration
variable specification, which is described in the C<Git::Hooks>
documentation. It's useful for most access control check plugins.

=head2 push_input_data DATA

This method gets a single value and tucks it in an internal list so
that every piece of data can be gotten later with the
C<get_input_data> method below.

It's used by C<Git::Hooks> to save arguments read from STDIN by some
Git hooks like pre-receive, post-receive, pre-push, and post-rewrite.

=head2 get_input_data

This method returns an array-ref pointing to a list of all pieces of
data saved by calls to C<push_input_data> method above.

=head2 set_authenticated_user USERNAME

This method can be used to set the username of the authenticated user
when the default heristics defined above aren't enough. The name will
be cached so that subsequent invokations of B<authenticated_user> will
return this.

=head2 get_current_branch

This method returns the repository's current branch name, as indicated
by the C<git symbolic-ref HEAD> command.

If the repository is in a dettached head state, i.e., if HEAD points
to a commit instead of to a branch, the method returns undef.

=head2 error PREFIX MESSAGE [DETAILS]

This method should be used by plugins to record consistent error or warning
messages. It gets two or three arguments. The PREFIX is usually the plugin's
package name. The MESSAGE is a oneline string. These two arguments are
combined to produce a single line like this:

  [PREFIX] MESSAGE

DETAILS is an optional string. If present, it is appended to the line above,
separated by an empty line, and with its lines prefixed by two spaces, like
this:

  [PREFIX] MESSAGE

    DETAILS
    MORE DETAILS...

The method simply records the formatted error message and returns. It
doesn't die.

=head2 get_errors

This method returns a list of all error messages recorded with the
C<error> method.

=head2 nocarp

By default all errors produced by Git::Hooks use L<Carp::croak>, so that
they contain a suffix telling where the error occurred. Sometimes you may
not want this. For instance, if the user is going to receive the error
message produced by a server hook he/she won't be able to use that
information.

This method makes B<error> strip any such suffixes from its DETAILS argument
and to produce its own message with B<warn> instead of B<carp>.
