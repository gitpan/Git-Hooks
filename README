### Git::Hooks - Framework for implementing Git (and Gerrit) hooks

You can install this using in the usual Perl fashion

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

Or, if you have a Perl packager installed

    # with cpanm
    cpanm Git::Hooks

    # with CPAN
    cpan Git::Hooks

The documentation is in the module file.  Once you install
the file, you can read it with perldoc.

    perldoc Git::Hooks

If you want to read it before you install it, you can use
perldoc directly on the module file.

    perldoc lib/Git/Hooks.pm

This module is also in Github
