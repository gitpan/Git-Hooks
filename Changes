Revision history for Git-Hooks. -*- text -*-

\{\{$NEXT\}\}

First release, with two hooks passing tests: check-acls.pl and
check-jira.pl.

I decided to incorporate Git::More in this distribution instead of
making it a separate module.

The documentation is lacking and the functionality needs to be
expanded.
