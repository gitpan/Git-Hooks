* Transform the hooks in modulinos.

* Devise and implement a way for the plugins to register their
  configuration options and a suitable routine in Git::Hooks to grok
  them all. This would simplify plugin option processing.

* Implement the examples in https://github.com/schacon/githooks.

* Implement a git-hooks.groups configuration variable to centralize
  the group definitions for all plugins.
